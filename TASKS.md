## TASKS
- Refine pill animation
- Figure out where to put the time/day the task was created
- Refine selected row visual design
- Refine text entry to be much more pleasent.
- - Think of having the first line type and enter until it gets long enough then having it open to more of an actual editor automatically the user then sees their text turn to description and mimics the row list. Everything else in the panel blurs out.
- - We should wait til the user adds enough text that the description is populated with a couple of words and not just with one character.
